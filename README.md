Bolt Match All routes
======================

This extension can be used to create a match all route for multiple contentTypes.

So if you have two contentTypes, eg 'places' and 'countries' and you want them 
to be accessible through /amsterdam and /netherlands, this controller will check
them both.

Standard Bolt would mean the URL:
- /places/amsterdam
- /countries/netherlands
